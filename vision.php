<b><span style="font-size: 18.0pt">Each of us is just a human being. All together we are the noosphere, i.e., sphere of the mind! </span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal">This is why we, the people of the planet Earth, have come together here, on
 this web site to share our vision of goals and objectives that we, as the mankind, have in the nearest or foreseeable future. 
 </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal">To establish such goals and objectives we want, we first need to formulate
 the most important and urgent questions and/or problems which require our immediate attention and solution.
 </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal">Then, we are going to discuss possible answers to these questions and
 different approaches to solving these problems in the most effective, simple, and harmless way. 
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal">
We encourage each of you to submit questions or problems that you personally consider as the most vital for all of us now.
 To make your input more meaningful and less general, we would like to aggregate all you questions and problems into nine subject areas
 (see <a href="index.php?page=submitinput"><span style="color: #0070C0">Submit Item</a></span> page). 
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Please formulate your question or problem related to one of these areas. Then, submit your suggestion using the Submit button.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal">Your inputs will be published on
 our dashboard (<a href="index.php?page=submitinput"><span style="color: #0070C0">View Submitted</a></span>) 
 only if they only meet simple and obvious <a href="index.php?page=termsofuse"><span style="color: #0070C0">Terms of Use</span></a>.
All of them will be analyzed, aggregated, and prepared for voting. 
Finally, together we will determine a list of the most important questions and current problems of humanity. 
We will then vote on submitted inputs of all of you.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the next step, we will use the most effective methods of crowdsourcing, crowd creation,
 and crowd wisdom to discuss each of the high-rated problems and find the most possible and the most effective 
 solutions.
