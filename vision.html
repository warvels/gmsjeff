<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font face="Calibri">This is why we, the people of the planet Earth, have come together here, on this web site to share our vision 
of goals and objectives that we, as the mankind, have in the nearest or foreseeable future. 
</font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font face="Calibri">To establish such goals and objectives we want, first of all, to formulate the most important and urgent 
questions and/or problems which require our immediate attention and solution.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font face="Calibri">Then, we are going to discuss possible answers to these questions and different approaches to solving these 
problems in the most effective, simple, and harmless way. </font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font face="Calibri">We encourage each of you to submit questions or problems that you personally 
consider as the most vital for 
all of us now. To make your input more meaningful and less general, we would like to aggregate all you 
questions and problems into nine subject areas (see <u> <span style="color:#0070C0"><a href="submit.html">Submit Item</a></span></u>
page). </font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font face="Calibri">Please formulate your question or problem related to one of these areas.&nbsp; 
Then, submit your suggestion using Submit button. </font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font face="Calibri">Your inputs will be published 
on our dashboard (<u><span style="color:#0070C0"><a href="submitteditems.html">View

analyzed, aggregated, and prepared for voting. Finally, we all together will 
determine a list of the most important questions and problems that humanity 
meets now by free voting submitted inputs of all of you. </font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font face="Calibri">In the next step, we will use 
the most effective methods of crowdsourcing, crowd creation, and crowd wisdom to 
discuss each of the high-rated problems and to found their possible and the most 
effective solutions.&nbsp; </font> </p>
